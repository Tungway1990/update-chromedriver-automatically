When using selenium module, chromedriver need to be downloaded regularly as your Chrome browser frequently get updated.

I wrote a short program to check the current Chrome browser version and automatically download the relevnt Chromedriver version for Window user.

The way I check current browser version is reletively simple and maybe it is a general solution.
